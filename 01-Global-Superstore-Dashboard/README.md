  **Insights & Recommendations**

  *  **Insight 1 : Profitability Concern**
     * The Central region, despite generating sales, suffers from extremely low or even negative profit margins, especially within the Furniture category.
     * **Recommendation:** Initiate a cost analysis for furniture sales in the Central region. Investigate if high shipping costs or excessive discounting are eroding profits before making decisions about this product line.
   
  *  **Insight 2: High-Margin Product Focus**
     * The Technology category is the clear leader, consistently delivering the highest sales and profit.
     * **Recommendation:** Prioritize and increase marketing budget for new technology products, targeting top-performing countries(like the USA and India) to maximize return on investment.

  *  **Insight 3: Untapped Market Potential**
     *   Emerging markets, particularly in Africa, have a very small sales footprint and represent a significant growth opportunity.
     *   **Recommendation:** Propose a pilot marketing campaign in a key Africa market to test viability and assess the potential for long-term expansion.

  **Technical Skills Demonstrated**

  * **Power BI:** Data Modeling(Star Schema), Power Query for data transformation.
  * **DAX:** Creation of key measures('Total Sales', 'Total Profit', 'Total Quantity').
  * **Visualization:** Interactive KPI cards, bar charts, and geographical maps.
  * **Analysis** Translating data observations into actionable business recommendations.
